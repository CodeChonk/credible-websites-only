# credible-websites-only
This project is a chrome extension designed to help lock down access to non reputable websites. 

This project is intended to be used in tandem with other solutions available to Google Workspace for the centralized management of Chromebooks in a educational environment.

This chrome extension, when enabled will block access to any website not ending in .com, .org, .edu, .gov, or .net by redirecting it to a custom block page.

Free and open source. Have fun.
